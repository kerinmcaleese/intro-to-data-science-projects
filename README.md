# intro-to-data-science-projects
Jupyter notebooks and datasets from my early data analytics / data science learning journey (Python, pandas, visualization).
## About This Project

This repository documents my early hands-on learning in **data analytics and data science**.  
It includes Jupyter notebooks and small datasets that Iâ€™ve explored while practicing Python, pandas, and data visualization techniques.

Each notebook reflects a key concept from my foundational coursework:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Statistical visualization with matplotlib and seaborn  
- Introduction to predictive modeling  

The datasets, such as U.S. baby names and state baby names, are used purely for practice and educational purposes.
